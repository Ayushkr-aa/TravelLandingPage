# TravelLandingPage

During my internship at Codsoft, I had the opportunity to design and develop a dynamic landing page for a travel website, crafted entirely with HTML and CSS. The project aimed to provide users with a seamless and engaging way to explore and select their dream holiday destinations. Through this experience, I honed my skills in responsive web design, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface across all devices. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of front-end development and deliver a polished product that enhances the overall user journey
